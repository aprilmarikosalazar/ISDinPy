## Software Design Project in Python

I made a feed forward back propagation neural network!
It is built to train for classification tasks, regression tasks, 'exclusive or' problems, and more. This neural network will continue to receive coding updates whenever I feel inspired.

Click [here](https://github.com/aprilmarikosalazar/SDinPy/blob/main/SDinPy/FFBPNetwork.py) for the main script. And click [here](https://github.com/aprilmarikosalazar/SDinPy/blob/main/report_ffbpneuralnet.pdf) to see my high-level report on the training models, their settings and performance, and some sample runs.
